This is an implementation of the
[incident extension suite](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-common-objects/blob/main/extension-definition-specifications/incident-core/Incident%20Extension%20Suite.adoc).
It includes the incident extension itself, and `impact`, `event`, and `task`.

STIX bundles containing example content can be found under `/notebook`. Use
Jupyter Notebook to view the content and corresponding visualizations.

Tests can be run with Tox by executing the `tox` command.
